# Puzzle

This is a puzzle game, I developed this while I was learning Unity. You can take a photo, and then my puzzle game can turn it into a puzzle.

##### Technical detail(if you are not interested, just ignore this part)
This project is mainly about dealing with images, first, you need to calculate those coordination points and separate the image into dozens of pieces, and then shuffle them.
